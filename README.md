* Introduction

The Iris flower data set is a specific set of information compiled by Ronald Fisher, a biologist, in the 1930s. It describes particular biological characteristics of various types of Iris flowers, specifically, the length and width of both pedals and the sepals, which are part of the flowerâ€™s reproductive system.

Fisher considered the question of what linear function of the four measurements would maximise the ratio of the difference between the specific means to the standard deviation between species. Based on the combination of the four measurement features of the sample of plants in the iris datas set, he developed a linear discriminant model to discriminate or distinguish the Iris species from each other.

Discriminant analysis is a statistical classification method used when the dependent variable is categorical. Discriminant analysis looks for the best linear combination of independent variables that will discriminate between the categories of the dependent variables and to see if significant differences exists among the groups of predictor variables. 

It use is for people to explore the world of data mining, it has become a common testing tool in recent times.
